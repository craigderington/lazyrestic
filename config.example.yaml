# LazyRestic Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.config/lazyrestic/config.yaml and edit it

repositories:
  # Local repository example using password file (recommended)
  # Password files must have 0400 or 0600 permissions for security
  - name: local-backup
    path: /path/to/local/restic/repo
    password_file: ~/.config/lazyrestic/passwords/local-backup.txt

  # Using a password manager command (for advanced users)
  - name: home-backup
    path: /mnt/backup/restic
    password_command: pass show restic/home-backup  # Using 'pass' password manager

  # S3 repository example
  # - name: s3-backup
  #   path: s3:s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/restic
  #   password_file: ~/.config/lazyrestic/passwords/s3-backup.txt

  # SFTP repository example
  # - name: remote-backup
  #   path: sftp:user@host:/path/to/repo
  #   password_file: ~/.config/lazyrestic/passwords/remote-backup.txt

# Security Notes:
# 1. NEVER use plain-text passwords in this config file
# 2. Use password_file with secure permissions (0400 or 0600)
# 3. Or use password_command with a password manager like 'pass', '1password', etc.
#
# To create a secure password file:
#   mkdir -p ~/.config/lazyrestic/passwords
#   echo 'YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD' > ~/.config/lazyrestic/passwords/my-repo.txt
#   chmod 400 ~/.config/lazyrestic/passwords/my-repo.txt
